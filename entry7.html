            <em>why</em> you should do it
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hangboarding, or fingerboarding, is a fantastic method of training grip strength and endurance.
             For most climbers, more so than muscular strength, grip strength can be their limiting factor when it comes to sending routes.
             Similar to how many athletes supplement their climbing with lifting, in order to maximise strength, it's equally as important to externally exercise the minute finger muscles that allow a climber to stay on the wall despite hard crimps, pinches and slopers.
             Fingerboarding is the ideal method of doing so.
             Below, I've listed a comprehensive, beginner friendly routine that compliments your regular climbing regime.
             I've linked the source to this information <a href="https://trainingforclimbing.com/4-fingerboard-strength-protocols-that-work/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br>
            <em>warm-up</em>
            <ul>
                <li>light cardio (walking, stairmaster, etc.)</li>
                <li>dynamic stretching (leg swings, arm raises, etc.)</li>
                <li>low-grade climbs-- this varies individually, but I'd recommend starting from v1, advancing in volume exponentially until you reach a grade ~2 lower than your regular.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
            board workout:
            <ol>
                <li>Do a 12-second hang using a feature that you can barely hold for 15 seconds with maximum effort.</li>
                <li>Rest for exactly 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Do four more hangs following the above protocol. Each hang should be near maximal (rating of perceived exertion of 9 to 9.5 out of 10), but not quite take you to failure.</li>
                <li>After doing the first set of five hangs, rest for 5 minutes before doing a second set of five hangs.
                     Initially focus on training the half-crimp and open-crimp gripâ€”one set each.
                      Advanced climbers can do additional sets that target two-finger pockets (open-hand grip) and pinch grip.</li>
            </ol>
        <br>
            Continue with your climb as you normally would, whether it be a volume day/max effort day/projecting day.
        <br>
            Try to do a cooldown, and take your protein!
