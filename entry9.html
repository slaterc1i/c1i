            <h2>what you need to start, conquering fears, a statement on ambition, blah blah blah</h2>
            <p>
                I could list all of the material objects you need in order to start climbing here, but you could find that literally anywhere else. Now that I think about it, you could probably find everything contained on this website anywhere else. I’m gonna talk anyway. Approaching new spaces and new people is hard, and if it wasn’t then you probably wouldn’t be reading this.
I’ll impart onto you two pieces of wisdom that have granted me any and all fulfillment that I’ve found from climbing regularly. The first: nothing changes if nothing changes. You can’t wait for ambition, drive, chance, fortune, skill, satisfaction or commitment to knock on your door. If you don’t paddle, you’re going to sink. You’re sinking right now. Is it getting harder to breathe? Fucking move your arms. Your anxiety and fear do <em>not</em> care about your aspirations, so why the hell do you think they’d abate? Just go to a gym. Literally no one cares if you struggle or fall or get angry. You know why? Because it never stops. Weakness is the universal immortal. You’ll always be a victim to weakness, because everyone is. You’ll keep struggling and falling and getting angry so hear me when I say: fall <em>trying</em> to get somewhere.
The second piece of advice: you can’t change the wind, but you can always adjust your sails. Don’t practice self-pity, just work with what you’ve got. When you see someone better than you, it’s easy to fall into a mental loop of loathing, resignation, or even prayer. You’re designing a precedent that allows yourself to stay dormant. This sounds like cheap advice, but that person is only better than you because they took action. How about you do the same.
Thanks for listening, hope this helped.
